# TTH UL LeptonMVA

### Lepton MVA  files

xml files for Lepton MVA used in the ttH differential/EFT analysis using UL.

For muons, only the training labeled as TTH-like has been performed. This is due to the fact that in principle we expect muon UL training to perform worse than Legacy. On the other hand, ttH-like pre-selections go down to lepton pT > 5 GeV, while for legacy the threshold is lepton pT > 10 GeV.
